# Nand2Tetris
Building a Modern Computer From First Principles: From Nand to Tetris

See https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer/home/welcome and https://www.nand2tetris.org/ for more info.

Project 1
Starting from a Nand gate, created Not, And, Or, Xor, Mux (multiplexer), DMux (demultiplexer), Not16 (16 bit not), And16, Not16, Or16, Mux16, Or8Way, Mux4Way16, Mux8Way16, DMux4Way, and DMux8Way logic gates.

Project 2
Built a half adder, full adder, 16 bit adder, incrementer, and a simple ALU using the logic gates created in Project 1.
